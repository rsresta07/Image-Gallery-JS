### HTML Structure: 
Set up a simple HTML structure to display images, an input to add new images (like a URL input), buttons for adding and deleting, and a filter input to search through images.

### JavaScript Functions:
<b>Add Image: </b>
Capture the image URL input and store it in local storage.<br/> 
<b>Display Images: </b>
Load all saved images from local storage and display them.
<br/>
<b>Delete Image: </b>
Allow each image to be removed by clicking a delete button.
<br/>
<b>Filter Images: </b>Use an input field to filter images by a keyword (like part of the image name or description).

### Local Storage Management: 
Save the gallery images in local storage so that even after a refresh, the images remain until theyâ€™re deleted.
